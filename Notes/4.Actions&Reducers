* Actions (lines : 2 - 15)
    > Actions is the only way your app can interact with the redux store.
    > They carry inforamtion from app to redux store.
    > Actions are plain JS objects.
    > They have a "type" property that describes something that happened in the application.
    > The 'type' property is typically defined as string constants.

Note : An action is an object with "type" property. 


* Reducers (line : 20 - 33): 
    > Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
    > In terms of code we can say that , "Reducer accept state and action as arguments,
        and returns the next state of the application"

        (previousState,action) => state
    > We use switch statement in Reducer funtion.
       Eg : 
            const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
            switch (action.type) {
                case CAKE_ORDERED:
                return ({
                    ...state,
                    numberOfCakes: state.numberOfCakes - 1,
                });
                // If there are more than one property , we must use spread operator
                //otherwise only the updated value is present in updated state
                default:
                return state;
            }
            };
